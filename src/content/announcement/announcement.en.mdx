## 🚲 Data-Driven Bicycle City - Workshop on the ATRAI Data Platform

**How can mobility and environmental data contribute to improving cycling infrastructure?**  

As part of this workshop, we will present the current results of the ATRAI-Bikes project, funded by the BMFTR.  

Following a review of the latest developments and functions of the senseBox:bike, as well as initial workshops and campaigns in Münster, São Paulo, Wiesbaden, Arnsberg, and Greifswald, the workshop will focus on the **open-source data platform** developed in the **ATRAI project**—a tool for collecting, visualizing, and analyzing traffic data, designed to offer new possibilities for bicycle-related data analysis to citizens, researchers, and public administration.  

The platform uses, among other sources, data from the **senseBox:bike**, a mobile sensor platform for recording information on temperature, humidity, particulate matter, dangerous close passes by cars (AI-based), passing distances, and road surface conditions (AI-based).  

The core of the workshop will be a user test of the platform, exploring how to work with the data collected by senseBox:bikes, as well as a discussion of needs and wishes regarding functions, interfaces, file formats, or export options.  

**How can we gain insights from this—and how can these be used to help design a more sustainable cycling city?**

### What Are Lightning Talks?

During the workshop, we invite participants to give short (5–10 minute) presentations known as **Lightning Talks**. These talks offer a chance to share:

- Your own project or initiative
- A challenge you've encountered in data-driven urban development
- A fresh idea or perspective on mobility, air quality, or citizen science

It’s informal and open to everyone – just let us know in your registration if you'd like to participate!
